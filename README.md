# cputil
CPU performance utils and information tool CLI written in Python

```
$ cputil --help
cputil: cpu util CLI v3.4.3
usage: cputil [OPTIONS]

Options:
    -sg  --set-governor          GOVERNOR     set governor (root)
    -sfm --set-minimum-frequency FREQUENCY    set minimum frequency (root)
    -sfM --set-maximum-frequency FREQUENCY    set maximum frequency (root)
    -cpu CPU       Select which processor to affect with action,
                   if omitted the action will affect all processors,
                   to be used with -sg, -sfm, -sfM, -u
    -i   --info    Show info about CPU
    -g             Show general info only, to be used only with -i
    -u   --usage   Show CPU usage
    -avg           If specified, only average usage is shown,
                   to be used only with -u
    -j   --json    Outputs all the available informations in json format
```

Some systems might require root privilegies to read certain parameters. 
If some information is missing (e.g. current frequency in usage), try running `cputil` with sudo

The package also provides `cputil-tui`, which is a terminal-ui visualisation tool.
In order to use it, it is required to have `cputil` properly installed.
